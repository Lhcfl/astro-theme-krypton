## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helloworld.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ links.mdx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ about.md
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ consts.ts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

The theme will looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

And you can put any `.md` and `.mdx` pages in `data/pages/` directory, which will be rendered as static pages. For example, `data/pages/links.mdx` will create a `your-website.com/links/index.html`. The `data/` directory is a good place to put any static content that you want to render as pages and **being searched**, like an "About" page or a "Links" page.

For blogs, you can put your `.md` files in the `data/blog/` directory. Each file will be rendered as a blog post, and the theme will automatically generate a list of all blog posts at `your-website.com/blog/[filename]`.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
